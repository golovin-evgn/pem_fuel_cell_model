	abstract = {This work considers the controlled load change of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Due to the intrinsic nonlinearities of fuel cells, load changes are quite challenging. In the case of a low temperature PEM fuel cell, there is the possibility of undesired liquid water formation. Most available control concepts are heuristic linear controller structures based on a perfectly mixed fuel cell model. In this work a nonlinear controller for one-dimensional spatially distributed model of a PEM fuel cell is presented. The fuel cell model is derived from first principles. The concept of passivity is used to design the controller. A suitable control Lyapunov function is chosen and passivity of the fuel cell is shown. A state-feedback law is derived that can guarantee stability of the closed-loop system over a wide range of operation conditions. In order to make the feedback law applicable to fuel cells with limited measurement information an observer is designed. In a final step the state-feedback law and the observer are combined to an output-feedback controller. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
